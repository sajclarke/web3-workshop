4. Merge the 'step02' branch into 'dev' branch [git merge step02]
5. Continue working on the solution on the 'dev' branch

## Submitting an answer

After ensuring that your code fulfills the requirements of each exercise, you must submit the answer via a pull request as follows: 
1. Commit the necessary changes to the 'dev' branch [git add . && git commit -m "Answer to step02 (Shannon Clarke)"]
2. Checkout a new branch with a name respective to the exercise number [git checkout -b answer02]
